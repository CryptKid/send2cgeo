# send2cgeo

Script for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browser to send geocaches directly from your browser to c:geo on your phone.

## Version management

Changes should be based on the `master` branch.
Once the changes are validated and ready to release, the changes should be merged to the `release` branch. This merge has to include a raise of the script version number.

The script download link on the c:geo homepage directly targets the raw script on the `release` branch, which means after merging the changes to `release` users will get the update.
